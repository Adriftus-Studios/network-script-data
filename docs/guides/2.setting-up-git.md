## Fork and Clone a Git Repository

If you haven't already created a GitHub account, [create one now](https://github.com/join).

Log in to your GitHub account, and head over to [this repository](https://github.com/AuroraInteractive/network-script-data).

On the right-hand side of the repository banner, click the fork button. If you are in an organization, it will ask you to choose where you want to host the forked repository. Choose your personal account.

Next, clone your forked repository. You can do it on the GitHub page by clicking the green dropdown menu that says "Code". If you are a newcomer to Git, we advise you to clone the repository using **GitHub Desktop**, by clicking on _Open with GitHub Desktop_.

You are now ready to start contributing to Adriftus! We recommend you create a new branch by executing the bash command:

```console
$ git checkout -b <branch>
Switched to a new branch '<branch>'
```

Or, in GitHub Desktop, go to:

`Branch | New branch...  Ctrl+Shift+N`

In this branch, your changes will be commited here, without modifying the master branch.

One last thing we recommend you do is to add the original repository that you forked as a "remote" repository.

Using Git Bash, you can add the remote with this command:

```console
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ph4i1ur3/network-script-data.git
```

Doing this will allow for an easier time rebasing your repository.
