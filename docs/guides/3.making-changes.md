## Before You Edit a Denizen Script

In the previous section of this guide, we recommended you install [_Visual Studio Code_](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and get the [_DenizenScript_](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DenizenScript.denizenscript) extension. This is our recommended setup for writing Denizen scripts.

We also recommend you have a test server, for the purpose of testing and debugging scripts. Our network uses the [_Paper_](https://papermc.io/) server software, so we advise you to host a Paper server locally. You can easily do this on your computer. A dedicated server is not required for testing.

Of course, before you start making your changes, you should learn what _DenizenScript_ is, and how to use it. Read the [_Denizen Beginner's Guide_](https://guide.denizenscript.com/) to get started on learning DenizenScript.

## Understanding Our Code

Once you have read the _Denizen Beginner's Guide_, and have forked & cloned [`Ph4i1ur3/network-script-data`](https://github.com/Ph4i1ur3/network-script-data), you must understand our code.

To do this, you should read over the code, line-by-line. If you see something you do not understand, you can search it in the documentation [here](https://one.denizenscript.com/denizen/logs).

## Saving Your Changes as "Commits"

To properly log and save the modifications you have made into your forked Git repository, you must commit them using Git.

You can do this with Git Bash by typing:

```console
$ git add .

User@Computer MINGW64 ~/directory/repository (branch)
$ git commit -m "Commit message goes here."

[branch sha-1 short hash] Commit message goes here.
 x files changed, y insertions(+), z deletions(-)
```

Or using GitHub Desktop:

```md
Look to the bottom-left corner of the window.
There will be two text boxes, and a button that reads "Commit to <current branch>".

The first text box prompts you to write a summary of your unstaged changes.
  If no text is entered, it will default to "Update file_name.extension"
The second text box is a larger text field that allows you to further detail the changes made.

Below the text boxes, there is a button that, when clicked, will stages the changes made.
The button can only be pressed once a commit summary has been entered.
```
