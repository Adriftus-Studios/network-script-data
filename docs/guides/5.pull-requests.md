## How to create a Pull Request

To submit a pull request, go to your forked repository's page on GitHub. Click on the Pull requests tab.
Then, click the green button that reads, "New pull request".

This will bring you to a page that allows you to compare the head repository (your fork), to the base repository ([`BehrRiley/network-script-data`](https://github.com/BehrRiley/network-script-data)).

Choose the branch you made your changes in, using the right-most dropdown. Once you do, it will show a commit log, along with bolded text stating whether or not you can merge your changes into the base repository.

If you are able to merge into the base repository, click on the green button that reads, "Create pull request".

Once you have entered a title and description of the changes you have made, you can submit your pull request.

## Adding More Changes to Your Pull Request

If, for what ever reason, you need to make more changes to your pull request, you just push your changes to the branch your pull request is merging from.
