## Getting Started on Contributing to Adriftus' Network Repository

Do you work as an Adriftus staff member? Or, are you an external developer looking to propose improvements? If you're one of the above, then this _Getting Started_ guide will introduce you to pushing changes to our network.

### Adriftus Staff Team

If your team works with data that goes through many versions/iterations (e.g., Denizen scripts, resource packs, schematics, etc.), we advise you to clone this Git repository under your respective team's leader.

Developers, you will fork [`BehrRiley/network-script-data`](https://github.com/BehrRiley/network-script-data). All script additions/updates *must* go through the lead developer before being pushed to the development/production repository.

Artists and Modellers will fork a private repository belonging to the organization.

### External Developers

If you are an external developer wanting to contribute to this repository, you will fork [`AuroraInteractive/network-script-data`](https://github.com/AuroraInteractive/network-script-data).

All Pull Requests (PR) to the above repository will be reviewed by the administrative and development teams.
