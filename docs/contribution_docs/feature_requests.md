# Feature Request Template

### Requests should be limited per the general contribution rule, *common sense*. 

## Features should **avoid** the following features:
- Inequality: Give substantial benefits to a single player, or small group of individual players. We aren't providing random benefits to anyone who asks. *unless of course, they're a sponsor*. Privileged players typically receive special treatment. Call it a trip on our magic carpet.
- Over-complicated or game-breaking changes; Examples:
  - Pouring milk like water or lava - this is mechanically too complicated without creating complete modifications to the server that all players would have to own to participate playing (ie, mods)
  - Instant-killing attacking enemies - this isn't a realistic request, and would slaughter our less skilled or otherwise expecting players, unless it's something incredibly prepped for, such as a final-boss battle of a sort.
- Uncontrollable growth - Such as, 'the entire Diablo III quest series saga and RPG Adventure Gamemode'. This is too in-depth and too expandable for a single request without offering to contribute towards forming a sub-community to organize this type of request.

## **Good** feature requests should provide as many of these notes as possible:
- **The Type of request**: describe if this a one-off feature or a series of features
- **Who is requesting this**: identify yourself and who you represent, so that you can easily follow up with them as a major contributing producer to the idea.
- **Describe the feature** This is key for you to differentiate between people that have deeply thought about what you're requesting, or what this will solve for users versus those that are just in love with their idea.
- **Describe the impact**: Articulate how solving this problem will make yours and the other player’s life better. You can add impact categories that matter to you to ensure consistency.
- **Describe the reach of this feature**: You could describe how many users will be positively impacted or leverage this feature.
- **Describe the cost of not doing this request**: Describe the problems that would occur if this need was not addressed. To ensure consistency add categories that matter to us such as happier players, or adequate equality of other existing features or mechanics of the game.
- **Describe which goals this helps**: Enumerate our current goals and tie the feature to it - Expansion and dynamistic game-play is key for an awesome player-base and game-play environment.
- **Describe the evidence that you have on the need for this request**: Validation of user problem and desired outcome is statistically(no pun intended) the only way to argue with me if you believe I wouldn't agree else-wise. 
- **Describe if you have any ideas on how we may solve this**: Giving the space to help and suggest ideas are great for creating structural or dynamic features, mini-games and commands.
- **Describe how urgent this is and why**: Explain the space to give insight into the urgency of this issue and why.
