--->
> **Describe the feature**:
<!--- This is key for you to differentiate between people that have deeply thought about what you're requesting, or what this will solve for users versus those that are just in love with their idea. --->


> **Command Syntax**
<!--- Specify the exact usage this command would be used as well as what the command would do. Additionally, specify each sub-command / argument's usage if applicable. --->


> **Miscellaneous Arguments**
<!--- Specify any non-pertinent or miscellaneous features that would be either helpful or not explicitly related to the commands direct usage - such as: `/dcommand Help` | Would display a helpful syntax with explaination of usage and syntax of the command and it's sub-commands / arguments. --->


> **Command Flags**
<!--- Similar to arguments, specify flags (optimally with short-hands available) to change the outcome of data or information returned, if applicable. --->


> **Features to Implement**
<!--- Specific features that would be required to make this command work, if you are familiar with them. --->


> **Resources Needed**
<!--- If you are aware of specific conditions or features that we do not have access to, specify them here in a checklist formatted like this:
- [ ] To-Do | We need this because it's to-do.
This is not referring to scripts needed to be written in Denizen, but only explicitly features we do not currently have access to presently. --->
